
Observation : 
1. We can't directly apply machine learning models on the current variables as some are in mg/m^3 or, ug/m^3 or, ppb. So scaling has to be done.

2. There are 336 rows that doesn't provide any information. They have irrelevant value (-200) for almost all variables. It can be considered as outliner so we have dropped it

3. The original dataframe has column names with special charachter[ie, ., (,  ) ]. We have replaced it with "_" as it helps us to get 'ols' values to check accuracy.

4. There are 5 (PT08_S1_CO, PT08_S2_NMHC, PT08_S3_NOx, PT08_S4_NO2, PT08_S5_O3)columns that show meter reading so we can drop those and directly work on the pollution values. 


Conclusion :
1. We got the maximum accuracy of 0.92 by using trees with its best parameters with the help of GridSearchCrossValidation.

2. We have used both temperature ("T") and Absolute Humidity ("AH") as target columns and all other variables as input predictors except ("Date", "Time").

3. Using regressor models, we found column ("CO_GT") doesn't contribute much to the output performance, hence we omitted it

4. We used Logisitic Regression on "Time" and got an accuracy of 0.2. It's really poor. Hence we are dropping the idea of treating this dataset as classification model.

5. While using trees, we found 2 columns (CO_GT, NMHC_GT) that have p-value > 0.05, hence we removed them.
